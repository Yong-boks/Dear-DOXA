  <h1>📸 Memory Lane</h1>

  <div class="memory">✨ Remember that one time we used to walk to the dorms together after the late night preps as we talked of random things?</div>
    <p> I really enjoyed those short walks, they werent much but they got us to know more about each other...I dare say that they were the beginning of this, our friendship...
      and thats just ... AMAZING!!!
    </p>  
 <div class="memory"> 🎉 Remember when we were in a bus on our way back home... then some men ever so casually boarded the bus,
 giving not much of a choice but to keep our heads down till they got off? 🤣🤣</div>
    <p> Because of that, im always on high alert when passing through that road...Even after leaving that hellhole, they still found a way to traumatize us!🤣🤣 </p>

<div class="memory"> Rememer when we went on a week long trip to South Korea and it felt like we accidentally got cast in a K-drama-</div> 
    <p> Getting lost in subway stations, fangirling at random k-idols' posters in the middle of the streets,
      watching sunsets at Han River and living off street food coz we we spent all the money at concerts and kpop merch 🤣🤣...</p>
    <p> Yeah... me too.. I really hope that that day will come, and i get to experience it all with you and no else...</p>
  
  <p>The days will come, when pages could be filled with the many memories we would have shared, and not just little visions, dreams and wishes...
    And when those days pass, i pray that we'll be able to share them with our kids (if we get any...but adoption sounds better honestly)
    and laugh about it till our chests hurt 🥲 </p>
