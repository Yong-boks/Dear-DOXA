  <h1>📸 Memory Lane</h1>

  <div class="memory">
    ✨ Remember that one time we used to walk to the dorms together after the late night preps as we talked of random things?
  </div>
  <div class="cute-paragraph">
    I really enjoyed those short walks. <br>
    They weren't much, but they let us know more about each other.<br>
    Honestly, I dare say those little strolls were the beginning of our friendship...<br>
    And that's just... <b>AMAZING!</b> 🌟
  </div>

  <div class="memory">
    🎉 Remember when we were in a bus on our way back home...<br>
    Then some men ever so casually boarded the bus, giving not much of a choice but to keep our heads down till they got off? 🤣🤣
  </div>
  <div class="cute-paragraph">
    Because of that, I'm always on high alert when passing through that road.<br>
    Even after leaving that hellhole, they still found a way to traumatize us! <br>
    <i>(I can't help but laugh every time I think about it!)</i> 🤣🤣
  </div>

  <div class="memory">
    🌏 Remember when we went on a week-long trip to South Korea and it felt like we accidentally got cast in a K-drama?
  </div>
  <div class="cute-paragraph">
    Getting lost in subway stations.<br>
    Fangirling at random K-idols' posters in the middle of the streets.<br>
    Watching sunsets at Han River.<br>
    Living off street food because we spent all our money at concerts and on K-pop merch 🤣🤣.<br>
    <br>
    Yeah... me too. I really hope that day will come, so I get to experience it all with you and no one else.
  </div>
  
  <div class="cute-paragraph">
    The days will come when pages could be filled with the many memories we would have shared, <br>
    and not just little visions, dreams, and wishes...<br>
    <br>
    And when those days pass, I pray that we'll be able to share them with our kids <br>
    (if we get any... but adoption sounds better honestly) <br>
    and laugh about it till our chests hurt 🥲
