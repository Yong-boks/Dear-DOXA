  <h1>To My Bestest Human 💖 </h1>
  <p>
    I honestly don’t know where to start. There’s no real way to sum up how grateful I am for your existence.
    You’ve been my chaos partner, my therapist on speed-dial, and my peace in the storm. It took me a while to actually realise how lucky i was to have you as my friend, and not just any friend,
    a bestfriend. ive never had one of those before, and honestly, i never thought id even get any friend like that...never...
    Then you happened...💖
    My life’s better with you in it — full stop.
  </p>
  <p>
    So here’s your virtual love letter. I may not be able to buy you something shiny (yet 😏), or take you to a Straykids concert (yet 😏) ...
    but I promise what I’m giving you is worth more than gold (maybe even more): all my love,
    loyalty, and a lifetime supply of drama recaps and late-night talks. I cant promise to never piss you off 😏, neither can i promise to be the best at all times, 
    coz i know that I am lacking in many ways. I can't promise to always support your choice of men, im talking kenyan humans (if he aim't it then he ain't worth your precious time)...
    But we both know that the real men are out there making the best of their talents, abs and money...thats completely besides the point...😅
  </p>
  <p>
    What im trying to say is, im not perfect, no one is... But I can for sure make a promise to be there for you in everything you do, with every step you take, everyday, anytime, anywhere...
    i cant be your everything, but i sure as hell can be that friend you can run to whenever, that one friend who would kill for you, that one friend that would lay everything down and come running...
    I lack in many ways, but I love to the end of the earth, not even death can tear us apart, I'll make sure of it!!!....(ik 🙂‍↕)
    I lack in  many ways, but here's my promise to you, to always be your Best Friend...😊  
  </p>
  <p>
    Happy birthday, bestie. You deserve everything beautiful — 💗💗💜💗💗💛💗💗🩷💗💗🩵💗💗❤
